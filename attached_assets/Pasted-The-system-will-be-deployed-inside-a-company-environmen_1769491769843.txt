The system will be deployed inside a company environment and must integrate with the company Active Directory (LDAP).

Requirements:

Authentication & Login (LDAP Only):

Remove any existing user registration or sign-up functionality.

Replace it with a single login screen that asks for:

Employee ID

Password

Authenticate users exclusively via the company Active Directory using LDAP.

Do not store user passwords in the database.

On first successful login:

Auto-create the user record in the local database.

Fetch and store (read-only):

Employee ID

Full Name

Department

Email (if available from LDAP)

User Roles:

Support two roles:

Employee (default) – authenticated via LDAP.

Admin – defined by LDAP group membership (e.g. Learning_Admins group).

Role must be assigned automatically based on LDAP group.

Admin Panel (Separate Page):

Create a dedicated Admin Dashboard accessible only to admin users.

Admin dashboard must allow:

Viewing all employees.

Viewing employee performance:

Quiz scores

Progress per department

Completion rate

Assigning and managing:

Badges

Rewards / prizes

Manually granting badges or rewards to employees.

LDAP Integration (Admin Control):

Add an Admin → LDAP Integration section.

Implement functionality to:

Connect to LDAP controller.

Fetch all users from LDAP.

Verify and display:

Number of users fetched.

Sample list of usernames / employee IDs.

Validate that LDAP sync is successful.

Show clear success / error messages if:

LDAP connection fails

Credentials are incorrect

No users are returned

Security & Best Practices:

Use environment variables for:

LDAP server URL

Bind DN

Bind password

Base DN

Enforce session-based authentication.

Protect admin routes with middleware.

Log authentication and LDAP sync errors (without logging passwords).

UI Notes:

Keep employee UI simple (login → dashboard → learning → quizzes).

Admin UI should be clearly separated and not visible to normal users.

Tech Notes (if applicable):

Backend: Node.js (Express)

Authentication: LDAP (e.g. ldapjs or similar)

Database: existing project DB

No OAuth, no external identity providers.
