# Zlingo - Gamified Vocabulary Learning Platform

## Overview

Zlingo is a gamified vocabulary learning web application designed for telecom operator employees. The platform helps employees learn industry-specific terminology through interactive quizzes, flashcards, and competitive features like leaderboards and badges. Built with a modern React frontend and Express.js backend, it uses PostgreSQL for data persistence and OpenAI integration for AI-powered quiz features.

## System Architecture

### Frontend Architecture
- **Framework**: React 18 with TypeScript, built using Vite
- **Routing**: Wouter for lightweight client-side routing
- **State Management**: TanStack React Query for server state management
- **UI Components**: shadcn/ui component library with Radix UI primitives
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS with custom Zain-inspired color palette (primary red #ED1C24, secondary green #00A859)
- **Animations**: Framer Motion for page transitions and interactive animations
- **Special Effects**: Canvas Confetti for celebration animations

### Backend Architecture
- **Runtime**: Node.js with Express.js
- **Language**: TypeScript with ES modules
- **API Pattern**: RESTful API with Zod schema validation
- **Authentication**: Passport.js with Local Strategy, session-based auth using express-session
- **Password Security**: Scrypt hashing with timing-safe comparison
- **Real-time**: Socket.io server integration for future live duels

### Data Layer
- **Database**: PostgreSQL with Drizzle ORM
- **Schema Location**: `shared/schema.ts` contains all table definitions
- **Session Storage**: PostgreSQL-backed sessions via connect-pg-simple
- **Migrations**: Drizzle Kit for schema migrations (`drizzle-kit push`)

### Key Data Models

- **Terms**: Vocabulary with term, definition, example, and department categorization
- **Quizzes**: Quiz history tracking with type, score, and timestamps
- **Badges**: Achievement system with conditions for earning
- **UserBadges**: Junction table for user-badge relationships
- **Conversations/Messages**: Chat history for AI integrations

### Application Features
