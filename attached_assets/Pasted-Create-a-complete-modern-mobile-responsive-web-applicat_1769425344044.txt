Create a complete, modern, mobile-responsive web application called **Zlingo** using Replit. Zlingo is a fun, gamified vocabulary learning platform for employees of a telecom operator (e.g., Zain Jordan) to master work-related terms across departments: Marketing, Sales, Engineering, Legal, and HR.

### Core Requirements:

1. **Tech Stack (must work well in Replit)**:
   - Backend: Node.js + Express.js
   - Frontend: React.js (with Vite or Create React App – prefer Vite for faster setup)
   - Database: SQLite (using sqlite3 package) – store users, vocabulary terms, quiz scores, streaks, badges
   - Real-time (for duels): Socket.io
   - Styling: Tailwind CSS (or Bootstrap if easier)
   - Additional libraries: react-confetti (for win animations), chart.js (for progress visuals), bcrypt (password hashing), jsonwebtoken (JWT auth)

2. **User Authentication**:
   - Simple email + password signup / login
   - Store user data: email, hashed password, department preference, points, streak, badges
   - JWT-based authentication (protect routes)
   - Optional: Google OAuth if easy to implement

3. **Vocabulary Database**:
   - Pre-populate with 25–30 terms per department (at least 5–7 per department to start)
   - Each term has: term (string), definition (string), example (string), department (string)
   - Example terms (include ALL of these + add more if needed):
     - Marketing: ARPU, Churn, 5G, SAC, CLV, Bundling, Digital Channels
     - Sales: ARPU, SAC, LTV/CLV, Activation, Net Additions, MOU, DOU, Quota, Win-Back
     - Engineering: KPI, CQI, PRB Utilization, RSRP, RSRQ, SINR, Handover Success Rate, Throughput, Latency, VoLTE, VoNR
     - Legal: Roaming Agreements, Interconnection Agreement, Spectrum License, Net Neutrality, GDPR, SLA, NRA
     - HR: KPI, Onboarding, Attrition, Turnover Rate, Performance Management, PIP, Talent Acquisition, Employee Engagement
   - Admin route (password-protected) to add/edit terms

4. **Main Pages & Navigation**:
   - Welcome / Login page
   - Dashboard: Shows user stats (points, current streak, badges, progress rings or heatmap for departments)
   - Department Selection: Buttons for Marketing, Sales, Engineering, Legal, HR, All Departments
   - Quiz Center: Choose quiz mode
   - Flashcards page: Swipeable cards (Tinder-style)
   - Leaderboard: Top scorers (anonymous or team names like "Amman Champs")
   - Profile: View badges, streak, edit department preference

5. **Quiz Modes (make them fun and gamified)**:
   - **Daily Vocab Battle** (default/home quiz):
     - 3 questions per day
     - 60-second timer per question
     - Types: Multiple choice, fill-in-the-blank, match term-definition, scenario-based
     - Points + streak system (7-day streak → special badge)
     - Confetti + sound effects on correct answers
     - Leaderboard updates in real-time
   - **Scenario Escape Room**:
     - 4–5 question story-based quiz (e.g., "Competitor launched cheap plan → protect ARPU & reduce Churn")
     - Narrative + dramatic animations
   - **Term Duel**:
     - 5-question head-to-head (vs AI or real-time vs another user via Socket.io)
     - First correct answer gets point
     - Funny memes/GIFs on wrong answers
   - **Emoji / Meme Translator**:
     - Match emoji combos to terms (e.g., 📉😭 = Churn, 💰👤 = ARPU)
   - **Progressive Difficulty**:
     - Level 1: Definitions
     - Level 2: Usage in sentences
     - Level 3: Scenarios
     - Level 4: Cross-department mix

   - /db: SQLite file
   - Seed script to populate vocabulary

10. **Replit Setup Commands**:
    Provide all necessary npm install commands
    Instructions to run backend + frontend together (e.g., concurrent dev servers)

Please generate the **complete code structure** with:
- All necessary files (server.js, App.jsx, components, routes, database schema, seed data)
- Ready-to-run package.json
